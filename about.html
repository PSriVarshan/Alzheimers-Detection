            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                AlzWELL is dedicated to advancing the early detection and management of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) through
                the integration of innovative deep learning technologies and medical research. Our goal is to provide
                tools and insights that empower proactive care and improve cognitive health outcomes.

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
                By leveraging cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for MRI analysis and comprehensive
                biomarker evaluation, AlzWELL offers a robust platform for identifying AD stages. We believe in bridging
                the gap between advanced AI capabilities and accessible healthcare solutions for all.

            <h2>Project Highlights</h2>
            <p>
                AlzWELL employs transfer learning techniques, utilizing pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet50 to
                ensure high accuracy in MRI classification. Our system is trained on large datasets such as the
                Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to differentiate between four diagnostic categories:
                Cognitively Normal, Early Mild Cognitive Impairment, Late Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer’s
                Disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, AlzWELL integrates an intuitive health data visualization module, which uses
                user-submitted health metrics such as glucose and cholesterol levels. These metrics are presented
                through color-coded visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of overall health.
